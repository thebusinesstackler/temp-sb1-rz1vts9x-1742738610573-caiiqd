    <h2>Clinical Trials Often Face Delays—Theranovex Fixes That</h2>
    <p>Clinical trials face delays that slow progress toward life-saving treatments. Sites often lack the resources and tools to overcome recruitment and compliance barriers. Theranovex brings modern, AI-driven solutions that streamline operations, improve patient access, and attract more sponsor interest.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Theranovex uses AI to solve patient recruitment bottlenecks for clinical trials</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>The Hidden Challenges Clinical Research Sites Face</h2>
    <p>Sites struggle with staffing, outdated workflows, and growing competition for participants. These pain points lead to missed timelines, legal complications, and added costs.</p>

    <h3>Recruitment Bottlenecks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inconsistent eligibility criteria cause 30%+ screen failures</li>
      <li>Overlapping studies compete for the same patient pools</li>
      <li>Sites lack centralized tools to manage outreach effectively</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resource Allocation Issues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 40% of staff time is lost to administrative work</li>
      <li>Compliance teams are under-resourced and reliant on outside legal review</li>
      <li>Manual workflows limit strategic recruitment planning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Cost of Delays</h2>
    <p>Each day of delay costs trials an average of $10,000. Beyond the financial toll, delays risk losing momentum, regulatory penalties, and critical treatment windows.</p>

    <h2>Theranovex: The Modern Site Enablement Platform</h2>

    <p>All activity feeds into one dashboard with live metrics. Study teams can track performance, adjust strategies, and manage compliance — all in one place.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies & Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One site improved enrollment by 60% in six months</li>
      <li>Another saved 200+ admin hours by automating IRB and consent tracking</li>
      <li>90% of sites using Theranovex retained future sponsor opportunities</li>
    </ul>
